                    <p>
                        As a versatile computer engineer, I bring to the table a 
                        decade of technical leadership experience gained through 
                        my tenure in the U.S. Navy. During my time in the Navy, I 
                        had the opportunity to lead diverse teams, tackle complex 
                        challenges, and develop innovative solutions in the ever-evolving 
                        landscape of technology. This experience has not only honed 
                        my technical Projects but has also instilled in me the importance 
                        of effective communication, adaptability, and resilience in the 
                        face of adversity.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my military background, I have also cultivated a 
                        solid foundation in systems engineering through my work at 
                        ASRC Federal Holding Company. Here, I had the privilege of working 
                        on a wide range of projects, from designing and implementing scalable 
                        systems to optimizing existing processes for maximum efficiency. This 
                        exposure to the intricacies of systems engineering has further enriched 
                        my skill set, allowing me to approach problems with a holistic perspective 
                        and deliver comprehensive solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of 
                        each project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am driven by a passion for innovation and a relentless pursuit of excellence. 
                        I thrive in dynamic and challenging environments where I can apply my technical 
                        expertise to drive growth and foster innovation. I am excited about the opportunity 
                        to leverage my proven Projects and experiences in a challenging engineering role, 
                        where I can contribute meaningfully to the success of the team and organization 
                        while continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of technology.

                <P>   
                    Each statement will be about a particular artifact. The statement should discuss why you wrote or created the artifact the way you did, and why you chose to include it in your portfolio. How does that artifact contribute to the picture of yourself youâ€™re trying to present in your portfolio? The point of these short statements is to showcase your critical thinking skills, so give them some time and attention. Be sure to have just one idea per paragraph.
