            <h1>Welcome! I am Ryan Koepke</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I am an experienced computer engineer with ten years of leadership 
                experience from my time in the U.S. Navy. In my time with the Navy, I led 
                teams to solve complex problems and developed new solutions in fast-paced 
                environments. This journey sharpened my ability to prioritize tasks efficiently, 
                adapt to new challenges, and deliver high-quality solutions under tight deadlines. 
                These experiences improved my technical skills and taught me the importance of clear 
                communication, being adaptable, and staying strong when faced with difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond military service my professional path led me to Arctic Slope Regional 
                Corporation where I cultivated a solid foundation in systems engineering. Here, 
                I had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from designing and 
                implementing scalable software to optimizing existing processes for maximum 
                efficiency. This exposure to the intricacies of systems engineering has further 
                enriched my skill set, allowing me to approach problems with a wider lens, 
                ensuring I provide well-rounded solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of 
                each project.
            </p>
            <p>
                My motivation stems from a desire to learn and utilize my technical expertise 
                for problem-solving. I thrive in environments that are both dynamic and demanding, 
                where I can use my technical skills to promote growth and encourage innovation. 
                I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my proven Projects and experiences 
                in a challenging engineering role, where I can contribute meaningfully to the 
                success of the team and organization while continuing to push the boundaries of 
                what is possible in the field of technology.

                    Each statement will be about a particular artifact. The statement should discuss why you wrote or created the artifact the way you did, and why you chose to include it in your portfolio. How does that artifact contribute to the picture of yourself youâ€™re trying to present in your portfolio? The point of these short statements is to showcase your critical thinking skills, so give them some time and attention. Be sure to have just one idea per paragraph.
