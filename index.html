                    </div>
                    <P>   
                        I created the "Black-Spot" Tank Robot project because I'm really interested in how software and hardware work together to make real-world things. I wanted to create something that can be used by people to interact with one another from across the world. I used a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to push my skills in programming and engineering and to show how Internet of Things (IoT) devices can make robotics fun and more accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inclusion of the Black-Spot Tank Robot in my portfolio shows a broad spectrum of my capabilities, spanning both hardware and software development. The development of the Black-Spot Tank Robot required a deep dive into both the mechanical and computational realms, which integrated various technologies, such as controlling a Arduino using a Raspberry Pi. From designing the physical chassis to programming the control logic, every step was a lesson in hardware and software design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Critical thinking and project management skills were crucial throughout the development process, especially when integrating a camera for enhanced user interaction. This addition not only improved the robot's interactivity but also introduced the complexity of real-time video processing. Similarly, implementing remote control capabilities demanded a thorough understanding of network communications, ensuring the robot could be maneuvered effectively over the internet.

                    <p>
                        The Rivera Landscaping website is meant to showcase my web development skills and my ability to build digital solutions that directly contribute to achieving business goals. Using JavaScript, along with modern web design principles, I was able to combine aesthetic appeal with the functionality essential for a landscaping business's online presence. This project was thought of with the specific goal of addressing the needs of the Rivera Landscaping business. From user interface design to content management, it was tailored to enhance the companyâ€™s visibility and engage its customer base effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is to show that I can apply skills in front-end and back-end development. Front-end development used modern JavaScript frameworks to create a responsive, mobile-friendly design, ensuring the website's optimal performance across a variety of devices and screen sizes. On the backend, Node.js was used to build a robust server-side solution for efficient handling of requests, data processing, and integration with databases for dynamic content management. This setup allowed for real-time updates to the website content, including service offerings and project galleries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By integrating this project into my portfolio, my goal is to show my comprehensive skill set in web technologies and my understanding of how digital platforms can be used to bolster a business's market position and interaction with customers. The Rivera Landscaping website is more than just a project. It is a useful application of my skills for business.
