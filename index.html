                        Hello! I have a decade of experience in the U.S. Navy. During my time I served as a Meteorological and Oceanographic Forecaster tasked with providing Navy personnel critical weather and oceanographic information. I also had the opportunity to be a leader and grow as a professional.  My military career has instilled in me several skills and attitudes that I apply to everyday life.  I am a quick learner and able to adapt to new challenges when they arise. I have proven myself as someone that can solve complex issues and deliver results in fast-paced environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post military while attending University I joined Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) where I gained substantial experience in systems engineering. I worked with a team of engineers and scientists as a Satellite Product Engineer. During my time at ASRC I developed valuable technical and engineering skills. My contributions included monitoring sensor performance on 16 spectral bands of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and recommend replacements when needed. I used my programming skills in Python and JavaScript to write software that enhanced management situational awareness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my career, I committed myself to various technology-focused groups centered around Artificial Intelligence (AI). I attended AI meetup groups, where I collaborated with data science engineers and developers to discuss new trends in AI and machine learning. These meetings have given me some insight into AI while connecting me to others who have similar interests as mine. By going to these meetings, my goal is to learn and grow both personally and professionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm looking forward to using my skills and experience in a challenging engineering role, where I can make a meaningful impact and contribute to the success of the team and organization while exploring new possibilities in technology.

                    </div>
                    <p> 
                        I have always been interested in game design. After gaining academic experience with several programming concepts and languages I wanted to put them to the test, so I set out to create a game engine.  Although I have no formal knowledge of game engine design, I created the “Sasha” game engine with the help of Cherno’s YouTube tutorials to challenge myself and to gain a better understanding of the C++ language. I like to name my projects and I named it “Sasha” because I had a cat at the time that tragically ran away, and it seemed like a fitting name for this engine to remember her by. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was driven by the challenge of applying theoretical programming knowledge to something that practical. This game engine is designed with many modern features for rendering techniques. These include OpenGL for both 2D and 3D graphics that incorporates shader programming for dynamic lighting and shadow effects. It has a physics and memory management system for realistic collision detection and response. Input handling implementation allows for users to use a variety of controls and input devices. It also features a custom entity-component system (ECS) that utilizes a modular approach for efficient game object management and scene composition. This greatly optimizes performance and scalability in the engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For future implementation I hope to integrate networking capabilities and cross-platform compatibility. Also, I plan to improve the engines handling of game assets to make faster load times and performance during gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This game engine is meant to showcase my proficiency in C++ programming concepts and my ability apply them in a real-world application.

                        <a href="https://github.com/rkoepke1/Black-Spot" target="_blank">Black-Spot Tank Robot Project</a>
                    </div>
                    <P>   
                        I created the "Black-Spot" Tank Robot project because I'm really interested in how software and hardware work together to make real-world things. I wanted to create something that can be used by people to interact with one another from across the world. I used a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to push my skills in programming and engineering and to show how Internet of Things (IoT) devices can make robotics fun and more accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inclusion of the Black-Spot Tank Robot in my portfolio shows a broad spectrum of my capabilities, spanning both hardware and software development. The development of the Black-Spot Tank Robot required a deep dive into both the mechanical and computational realms, which integrated various technologies, such as controlling a Arduino using a Raspberry Pi. From designing the physical chassis to programming the control logic, every step was a lesson in hardware and software design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Critical thinking and project management skills were crucial throughout the development process, especially when integrating a camera for enhanced user interaction. This addition not only improved the robot's interactivity but also introduced the complexity of real-time video processing. Similarly, implementing remote control capabilities demanded a thorough understanding of network communications, ensuring the robot could be maneuvered effectively over the internet.

                        <a href="https://github.com/rkoepke1/Rivera_Landscaping" target="_blank">Rivera Landscaping Website Project</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Rivera Landscaping website is meant to showcase my web development skills and my ability to build digital solutions for businesses. The company I designed this website for was called Rivera Landscaping owned and operated by my brother in-law. To implement this project I used JavaScript, along with modern web design principles. My aim was to combine aesthetic appeal with functionality that fit the needs of landscaping business's online presence. Not only did I implement the technical solution for this website but also took a creative approach to the design. I worked with Blender and photoshop to design the logo and other aspects of the site.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This project is to show that I can apply skills in front-end and back-end development. Front-end development used the React frameworks to create a responsive, mobile-friendly design. I ensured the website's performance worked across a variety of devices and screen sizes, including mobile and desktop. On the backend, Node.js was used to implement server functionality for efficient handling of requests, data processing, and integration with databases. This setup allowed my brother in-law and his managers to make real-time updates to the website content, including service offerings and project galleries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By integrating this project into my portfolio, my goal is to show my comprehensive skill set in web technologies and my understanding of how digital platforms can be used to enhance a business's market position and interaction with customers.
