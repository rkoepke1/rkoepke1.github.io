                        Hello! I am an experienced computer engineer with ten years of 
                        leadership experience from my time in the U.S. Navy. In the Navy I led teams to 
                        solved complex problems, and developed new solutions in fast-paced 
                        environments. This journey sharpened my ability to prioritize tasks efficiently, 
                        adapt to new challenges, and deliver high-quality solutions under 
                        tight deadlines. These experiences improved my technical skills and 
                        taught me the importance of clear communication, being adaptable, and 
                        staying strong when faced with difficulties.

                        Beyond military service my professional path led to me to Arctic Slope Regional Corporation 
                        where I cultivated a solid foundation in systems engineering. Here, I had the privilege of working 
                        on a wide range of projects, from designing and implementing scalable 
                        software to optimizing existing processes for maximum efficiency. This 
                        exposure to the intricacies of systems engineering has further enriched 
                        my skill set, allowing me to approach problems with a wider lens, 
                        ensureing I provide well-rounded solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of 
                        each project.

                    The "Sasha" game engine project highlights my exploration and growth in C++ and game creation, guided by Cherno's YouTube tutorials. This project is to showcase a practical application of advanced programming concepts. By featuring it in my portfolio, I aim to showcase my ability to independently learn and navigate the complexities of software development. This project reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and my passion for transforming game concepts into reality, showcasing my skills in C++ programming and innovative problem-solving.

                    The "Black-Spot" Tank Robot project shows how I combined advanced technology to build a robot that you can control from anywhere using the internet. I used a Raspberry Pi to act as the robot's brain and an Arduino to control its movements. I also added a camera that can move around to make the robot more interactive and fun to use. This project highlights my skills in both computer programming and building mechanical systems. By making the robot internet controlled, I aimed to make complex robotics easier for everyone to use and enjoy.
